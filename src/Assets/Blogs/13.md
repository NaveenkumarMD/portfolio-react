# Implementation of the 4 Pillars of OOP in Python and Java



Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language since everything in python is an object. Before implementing the concepts, let's look at what OOPS is and its four pillars. There are two types of programming methods or paradigms. They are:

* Procedural Programming

* Object-Oriented Programming

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a programming model which uses functions as its main component or works upon calling different functions (procedures).

### OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a type of programming model which works upon objects.

The four pillars of OOP are

* Inheritance

* Encapsulation

* Polymorphism

* Abstraction

Defining a new class and object in Python:

### Inheritance

It is a mechanism in which one class (child class) inherits the properties (attributes) and behaviours (methods) of another class (parent class).

### Encapsulation

It is the bundling of the methods with the data on which the methods operate. Python code:

### Polymorphism

It is the ability of objects to have different forms.

### Abstraction

It is the method of hiding the implementation and revealing only the functionalities to the user.
