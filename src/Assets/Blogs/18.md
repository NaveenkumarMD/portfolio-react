It's been a long time since the react-router v6 has been released but still, most of the developers find it much more difficult to get used to it. I too found it more difficult initially. I think it may be because of the obscure documentation or we people got attached tightly to the react-router v5. But still, as modules get updated we too must get updated.

In this guide, I will not be explaining to you how to use react-router-dom v6 in your project. But I will be covering the most important matter which is passing data between pages. I will be covering 3 ways of accomplishing it but still, these are not the only methods and I am not saying these are the best methods.

## Methods

1. Through URL Query Params

1. Through URL States

1. Through URL params

### 1. Through URL Query params

A query string is a part of a uniform resource locator that assigns values to specified parameters. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML, choosing the appearance of a page, or jumping to positions in multimedia content.

### Defining the routes

While defining the routes there is no need to change anything or configure anything. Just your normal route is enough to use query params.

### Defining the link and navigating

In React Router v6 we have the createSearchParams() method to append the query params from the object we have given.

### Getting the data

Use the useSearchParams hook to get the query params. It is similar to the useHistory hook. At first, we will be assigning it to a variable and then we will be accessing the methods. It’s the same here.

### 2. Through URL States

States are variables sent through the link. The router link contains specialised fields for the state variables. The state variable could be of any type.

### Defining the routes

While defining the routes there is no need to change anything or configure anything. Just your normal route is enough to use query params.

### Defining the link and navigating

While defining the link just add another key named state to it and add your variables to the state.

### Getting the data

The data sent through can be accessed through the useLocation hook.

### 3. Through URL params

Params are like dynamic routes. Here instead of route names, it will be filled with the values.

### Defining the routes

While defining the routes themselves, you have to mention the variables that are to be used through : symbol. This method is effective only if you know the variable in the initial stage itself.

### Defining the link and navigating

While defining the link just replace the params with the values.

### Getting the data

The data can be accessed with the useparams hook.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right method solely depends on your wish and the type of project.
