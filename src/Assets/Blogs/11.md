# Introduction to List Methods in Python



I am a Python and JavaScript developer. I have been working on these languages for a long time. At some time I thought of why don't we create our methods for datatypes. Then with JavaScript, I created a module named master methods with some additional methods to the primary datatypes. I have published the repository and surprisingly many people like this and have been using this module in this project.

And now we shall create our methods for the list data type in Python. The list is a linear data type that looks similar to arrays in other programming languages with a slight difference that in most of the cases array can store data of a single data type but in this case, the list can store data of any datatype.

Lists are mutable and can be easily used in different scenarios. Lists are dynamic in Python which means there is no need for mentioning the size of the list while initializing. It makes it much easier to add or remove elements from it.

### List Methods

* append()

Used to push an element in the list.

* clear()

Removes all the elements of the list.

* copy()

Returns an exact copy of the list.

* count()

Returns the count of the value in the list.

* extend()

Similar to append but for multiple values like an array or tuple iterables.

* index()

Returns the position of the element provided of the first occurrence.

* insert()

Used to add an element at specific positions

* pop()

Remove an element from the specific position if nothing provided removes the last element.

* remove()

Removes the first occurring with the given value

* reverse()

Reverses the order of the list.

* sort()

Sorts the list.

### Creating Our List Methods

In Python, every data type is a class and its methods are the methods of the class.

When you are initializing a data type, you are creating an object of the class of the specific data type. And if you want to create your methods for the data type you can create your class with the same name with inheriting the base class.

In the above code, I have defined the class List by inheriting the list class.

And now you can see that I have created a list and also called my method along with the other built-in methods.

That’s it for this article. Hope it helps. Thank you for reading.
