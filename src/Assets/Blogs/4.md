I don't like to beat around the bush. I shall directly get into the content. In this, we will be seeing about the 2-dimensional arrays and how to work with them.

## **Basic Structure**

Lets see the structure of a basic 2 dimensional array

arr=[ [1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]

This is how a simple 2d array looks which consists of rows and columns.

## **Syntax**

To define a 2d dimensional array the syntax is completely the same as the 1d array in python.

**Declaring an empty array “arr=[]”**

**Assigning some elements “arr=[[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]**

## **Getting inputs to a 2d array**

There are many ways in getting input to a 2-dimensional array. Let us discuss some of the most used methods.

**Using traditional double for loops**

Code:

Output:

**Using one-liners**

Code:

## Declaring 2d arrays with null values or 0

Sometimes we may end up in a situation where we have to create an array with null values like when you are working with a sparse matrix there would be only fewer values.

**Code:**

## Accessing elements from a 2D array

Accessing the elements is very easy. let's think of a 2d array as a list that contains some more lists in it. Consider the inner lists as a single variable. Thus we can get the elements by using “arr[i][j]”

## Conclusion

I have included all the basics If you find something wrong or like to add something feels free to comment
