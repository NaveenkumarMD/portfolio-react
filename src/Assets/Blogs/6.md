# How to Deploy a Webpage to Firebase



## Optional Prerequisites

1. Node

## We will be following some steps to host our code to firebase.

1. Install firebase-tools

1. Log in with your Google account

1. Initializing firebase in the project directory

1. Finally deploying

## 1.Install firebase-tools

I will be using npm to install firebase tools since most of the developers nowadays work with node js and definitely they will have npm and node installed on their machine.

npm i firebase-tools -g

You must be installing firebase globally on your machine so that you can use it on other projects and globally everywhere around your machine.

For the PHP and developers other than js I can help you by providing the link to the documentation. You can learn how to install firebase tools on your machine without npm.

[Get started with Firebase Hosting (google.com)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)

## 2. login with your Google account

I hope you have installed firebase-tools successfully on your machine .lets move further by login with our google account. Firebase is a part of google and you definitely need a google account to move further.

firebase login

You will be asked for permission for firebase to work with your command line. Just enter Y.

After accepting this you will be redirected to the Google sign-in page. Select your desired mail id to use for the firebase.

A successful process will look like this.

## 3.Initializing firebase in the project directory

Firebase tools have been installed and we also logged with our google account. The next step is initializing the firebase on your project. Open your desired command line or terminal on your project directory and enter the command below.

firebase init

You can clearly see that after the command two files have been created. One is the firebase-debug.log and the other is the firebase.json.Think this firebase.json similar to the package.json which contains the details about the project while the firebase.json contains the details like the deployment directory and things that are related to firebase.

Enter Y to proceed. In the next step, you will be asked about the features to be used by you from firebase.

Here we are gonna use firebase only for hosting so use the arrow keys to move the cursor to hosting. Now we are deploying our pages only from our local directory and we are not using GitHub auto deploys. If you want to know how to use GitHub auto deploys, just comment.

If you have already created a Firebase project using the firebase website go with “use an existing project”.Else go with “create a new project”

Provide a valid project id (note: It would be included in your URL). So plan accordingly. Next, enter the project name you can give whatever you like.

In the next step, you will be asked to provide the directory. The files inside the directory only will be hosted. While you are using any web packs you can build your code and can select your build directory(For React, Vue, and so on). But here I am just hosting my HTML code. So I go with “/”. The slash represents the current directory.

If you have a build folder inside the working directory.

/build or simply build

After choosing the directory answer the following questions according to your project.
