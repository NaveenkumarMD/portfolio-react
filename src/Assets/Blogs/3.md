# Python — Different Ways of Getting User Inputs for Competitive Programming



Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted, high-level programming language. Because of its simplicity and dynamic typing, many people use Python as their first choice for competitive programming.

The first and foremost thing in programming is getting input from the user. Most of us face problems in choosing the right method to get the inputs. Our basic requirement remains taking input in a way that causes the least amount of problems. Let’s see some of the methods to get the input from the user for different data types.

## Data types in Python

1. int

1. float

1. complex

1. boolean

1. str

1. list

1. tuple

1. dict

1. set

1. bytes

## 1. int

Int is the most used basic data type which represents all the integers. In almost all of the programs, there will be an input number that may represent the count, size, id, and so on.

The input() method always returns a string which it got from the user. If we need an input of type int we have to enclose the input function with the int function converts the numbers of type str to int. The int method raises an error if the given string cannot be converted into an int data type.

**Getting two or more numbers in a single row**

In some cases, we have to get two or more numbers in a single row. This problem can be solved by the split method.

In the above example, you can see that I have given the input as “1 2” and it has been separated and initialized to two different variables. This is because the input function returns the input in str datatype. *split is a* string method which separates the string according to the *sep *parameter provided. Here I have not provided the *sep *since the default *sep *value is space so it separates the string between spaces and stores it as an array. Then we have used the spread method to get the separate values.

## 2. float

Float is a datatype which contains all the decimal values. The methods are the same as the int with a small change where int is replaced by float function.

## 3. complex

Complex numbers may be used in some places. Python uses j instead of i in complex numbers. 3+4i is represented as 3+4j. An example for getting input is given below

The complex method converts the given strong or float or integer to complex data type.

## 4. boolean

The bool() method in general takes only one parameter (here x), on which the standard truth testing procedure can be applied. **If no parameter is passed, then by default it returns false**. So, passing a parameter is optional. It can return one of the two values.

## 5. str

By default, every input is a string in Python. So there is no extra method needed to convert the input to a string.

## 6. list

List is a special datatype which is simply an array with elements of any data type.

There are many ways of getting input for a list. The first method is an iterative approach

using Python split method (one-liner)

using map method (one-liner)

## 7. tuple

When it comes to tuples, everything is the same as the list.

We’ll cover the rest of the data types in the next article.
