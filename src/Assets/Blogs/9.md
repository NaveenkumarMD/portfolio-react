# Express with TypeScript: Create a REST API



In this article, we are going to create a REST API that works on JSON data with Express and TypeScript. You guys will be familiar with Express and JavaScript. Let's see how we can create an API with TypeScript and Express.

### Let's split the work into smaller pieces

* Installing and initializing TypeScript in the project

* Creating an empty Express project with type annotations

* Initializing the routes

* Compiling and running

### 1. Installing and initializing TypeScript in the project

Here we need a TypeScript module to be installed from the npm registry. We are installing TypeScript globally so that we can use it on other projects and once our project has been compiled there is nothing to do with this module. So don't install it in your project.

    npm i typescript -g

Now we can initialize TypeScript by using creating a **tsconfig **file. You can create it manually or you can use the command below to create a **tsconfig **file with default values.

    tsconfig â€” init

And then we have to make some changes to the **tsconfig.json** file.

The above changes are to be made. The *outDir *represents the output directory where our compiled are to be placed. Then the *rootDir *represents the input files to the TypeScript compiler that's your TypeScript files. We are making the resolveJsonModule flag to true since we will be importing JSON files in our API. Finally, the type is mentioned as a node.

### 2. Creating an empty Express project with type annotations

TypeScript is initialized successfully and now we can install the required modules.

Install all the modules, I will be explaining the modules while we are using them in the code. We are installing an extra module called @types/Express just to get the default type of methods used in the Express. Create an index.ts file in the src directory and initialize the Express app.

### 3. Initializing the routes and functions

Our app has been created and it successfully running on port 8000 then we can initialize the routes and functions assigned to it. The request and response have the default types declared in the Express.

### 4. Compiling and running

The TypeScript code we have written must be compiled into JavaScript. And the JavaScript code can be run using node.
> tsc

The above script compiles the code and the compiled js will be placed in the outDir mentioned in tsconfig.js.The file structure will be the same. So you can easily understand what is going on.

And there is a shortcut to run the ts file directly. You can use the ts-node module to directly run the TypeScript files without compiling it.
> ts-node ./src/index.ts
