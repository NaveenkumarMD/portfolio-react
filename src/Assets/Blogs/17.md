GitHub readme file accepts a markdown file and it doesn't allow us to inject any JavaScript or CSS files. So, we are gonna use GitHub actions and Python to update the dynamic quotes daily.

### Steps involved

1. Creating a readme file.

1. Creating a Python script file to update the quotes.

1. Creating GitHub actions to run the script file and push the code again.

1. Scheduling the task to be run daily using corn jobs.

### Readme file creation

To display your contact details and details about your current working profile section you need to create a repository with the name as your username (GitHub username) and create a readme.MD file and insert all your static content inside your readme file and push it. Then you can see the parsed markdown on your profile page.

GitHub doesn’t allow us to integrate any stylesheets or JavaScript scripts with readme files to avoid phishing attacks. So, we will be updating the contents by directly manipulating the readme file instead of dynamic content in the readme file.

In this article, I will be inserting dynamic daily quotes in the readme files, but you can use this method to change any content on any files on any repository.

### Python script file

The Python script will retrieve a random quote from the quotes.json file and that quote will be inserted inside the markdown file. The quotes are loaded from a JSON file and a random quote is selected using random.choice() method.

### Inserting a special attribute in the markdown

To identify or search the location where we have to insert the quote we will be using a special attribute that means nothing and contribute nothing to the markdown but that helps us to find the location easily.

Here I will be using the tag *<p quote >……</p quote>.*

### Reading the readme file

While reading the readme file you should mention the encoding type otherwise you will run into many problems and the readme will not be read properly.

### Manipulating the file

The random quote is ready and the readme file is also read. So then we can manipulate the contents of the readme file just using string manipulation. The index for inserting the quote is found using the special tag we have included in the readme file. With that, we will be just inserting the quote with proper markdown and the contents of the readme file are altered.

This script file modifies the readme file, and then now we can schedule when to run this file using GitHub actions. Once the file run, it changes the content of the readme file but still, we have to push it again to see the changes in the readme file.

### Creating actions to run the Python script and push it again

GitHub actions allow us to carry out automated tasks on their server which include changing the contents on push, hosting on push, scheduling tasks, and so on. Here we will be creating an action to run the Python file and push it again.

Once we have created the actions then we can schedule them to run daily.
