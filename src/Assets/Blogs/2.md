## 5.React js

You have completed almost 70 percent.The most interesting thing is watiing for you .ie react.Hooks are the future for react and I highly suggest you learn functional components instead of class components.But most of the tutorials are based on classes since hooks were introduced just before. So,try to learn all the hooks and lifecycle methods.

After learning react you must have to learn redux or context api. If you want materials on that make a comment on the comment section. These tutorials and videos are personally selected by me and don’t think it as a asvertisement.
