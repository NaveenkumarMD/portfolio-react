### What is a trie?

The word “trie” derived from the word “retrieval”. Trie is a special type of tree data structure which is widely used to store and retrieve words as in a dictionary. The retrieval and search is very much fast compared to any other data structures thus it is used in keyboard suggestions, search suggestions and so on.It is also known as prefix since with the help of the prefix of the word we can retrieve the word.

### Properties of trie

* The root node is always null.

* A Trie node can have a maximum of 26 children since we are considering english alphabets, if you are using any other characters it may change accordingly.

* The siblings are sorted alphabetically.

* Each node can store a single entity.

## Basic operations and applications

### Operations

* Insertion

* Deletion

* Updation

### Applications

* Searching

* Autocomplete-suggestions

Here we are gonna see about the insertion and the applications.

### Implementations

The trie node has two entities children which is dictionary which contains the character as key and the other TrieNode as value and a flag value names as end which represents the end of a word.

In the trie data structure I am just creating a root with null values since the root of the trie will be always null.

### Insertion method

This insertion method will insert a word in a trie according to is characters.

Thus trie data structure has been implemented using python.

### Applications

The applications of trie are searching a string and suggesting a string using its prefix.

### Searching-return value(bool)

### Suggestions

I have included all the necessary comments for the code. And you can get the full code in the below gist.

The output of the above would be like:

And that’s it. We’ve implemented our very own trie data structure!

Thank you for reading. I hope you have found this useful.
