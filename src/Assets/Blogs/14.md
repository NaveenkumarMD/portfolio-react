# How to Automate Tasks Using Python and GitHub Actions

A step-by-step guide to creating a readme file every time you change the file structure or add a new file to the folder.

One of the boring tasks in development is to write the readme file and the worst thing in this is adding relative links to the files in the repository. We will be facing this situation when you are solving some of the coding series and if you like to mention the names of the problems you have solved, you will have to write all the topics and all the names of the files in the readme file and also you should make sure the relative link works.

Kind of boring, right?
> Don’t work for the code, make the code work for us

Let us make it much interesting by using Python to create a readme for us every time the file structure changes or you add a new file to the folder.

### Steps Involved

* Refactor the folder names

* Refactor the fille names to camel case

* Create a new readme file

* Add the files' names in the correct sections along with their relative links

* Create a job in GitHub actions to run the python script

* Create another job to push the refactored files and readme file to the current repository

In this article, I will be working with solutions for the [*coding series](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/three-month-week-four/challenges).*

### Refactor the Folder Names

While you are working on links or the file locations the file names or the folder names should not contain any space between its name since it could consider space-separated words as two strings and the linking does not work.

Folder structure

This is the folder structure. It contains five folders that contain the python files of the solution for the problems.

Let’s get all the files and folders in the directory and refactor the folder names and we should leave some of the folders like .git and .github.

### Refactor the File Names to Camel Case

File names with spaces cannot be used in relative links. So we should refactor the file names to camelcase.

### Writing the Content to the Readme File

The final result of the readme file would be like this:

### Creating GitHub Actions

The writereadme.py file works properly in the current environment and it refactors the file names and folder names. The next step is to automate the task by using Github actions the readme file should be executed in the GitHub environment and the resultant files should be pushed again to the current repository.

The first job is to install Python and execute the Python file. And the next job is to again push the changed files. Through this whenever I push to master the write readme Python script executes and the files and folder names get refactored and links will be provided in the readme file and again pushed to the master branch.
