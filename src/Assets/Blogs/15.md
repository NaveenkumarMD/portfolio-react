Chrome extensions are used by nearly 9 out of 10 users. Chrome extensions have become indispensable in our daily lives. However, the question arises, “Do we actually use all of these extensions all of the time?” The response is a resounding “NO.” We do not utilise these addons every time we use Chrome or another browser.

Even if we don’t utilise them, they continue to operate in the background, causing unneeded side effects and using a lot of RAM. By pressing “shift +esc,” you may examine the memory utilisation of extensions in Chrome’s task manager. There, you can see that the extensions have misappropriated the majority of the RAM consumed by Chrome from the system.

You can see that Chrome has been using about 600 MB of memory but the sad reality is that most of the memory has been used by the extensions (Service workers).

So, we’ll be creating a Chrome extension that will allow us to enable extensions just when we need them, without any reloading or complicated processes, and it will also save a lot of RAM. After deactivating all extensions, it is evident that the memory utilisation has been decreased by about 200MB.

Our final output would be like this, with extensions listed along with a toggle switch to enable and disable them on the go.

## **Developing the Extension**

Create a manifest.json file which contains the metadata required by the browser which should contain the name, version, description, manifest_version (for further details about manifest version visit [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/)). The default_popup represents the HTML file to be visible on clicking the extension and the permissions represent the permissions required by the extension.

Then we will be creating a basic HTML template with some styles in the index.css file and linking them and finally the essential part the .js file. It is also linked with the script tag.

The extensions and apps installed on Chrome can be accessed by using the management API from Chrome. In this, we need only the extensions so we get the extensions by leaving out the apps.

Once the extensions have been we can list them in the HTML by creating the item nodes and iterating over the array.

Finally, we will be creating a toggle button to enable and disable the extensions.

Everything has been completed and finally the enabling and disabling process. The setEnabled method takes the params app id and a flag to toggle it. Once the process has been completed a callback function is called there we are reloading the location which gives the desired result without refreshing all the extensions.

The development process has been completed. Now it's time to test our extension, we can load the extensions by enabling the developer mode in the browser extensions page and then click “load unpacked”, then select the folder with the code. Then you can see that the extension would be loaded and ready to use.
